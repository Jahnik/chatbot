Authoritarian Left: Ruling authority owns your body and your wealth.

Examples: most forms of Communism, Maoism, Stalinism, Marxism-Leninism, “Ingsoc” from 1984. Arguably: some forms of Fascism (such as Nazism).

Authoritarian Right: Ruling authority owns your body, but not your wealth.

Examples: Most forms of Fascism, Francoism, National Front (France), UKIP (United Kingdom), AFD (Germany). Arguably: Republican Party (USA), United Russia (led by Vladimir Putin).
